# About me


I'm a PhD student at the [University of Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://twitter.com/uvmcomplexity) in the [Computational Story Lab](https://twitter.com/compstorylab).

I conduct research related aggregate trends on social media, narrative capacity of social movements, and data ethics. 


#### Projects with the story lab team include [StoryWrangler](https://storywrangling.org), [Hedonometer](https://hedonometer.org), and [POTUSometer](http://compstorylab.org/potusometer/).
